## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I have no projects I am working on in github, but rather am exploring projects involving electric car navigation software.
I am learning the design and development process of circuit boards and their components.
If you have any information regarding these specialities or projects that cover them I'd love for you to share them with me at jhuefner@uci.edu
